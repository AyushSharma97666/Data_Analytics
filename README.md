Google Data Analytics Certificate Case Study 


Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

###Introduction:

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study!
This case study represents course 8 “Capstone project” of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera

###The Scenario:

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximising the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the data analytics team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

###About the company:

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. Cyclistic has flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Moreno, the director of marketing, has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

There are three questions that will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Moreno has assigned me the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

###The business task:
Analyse the Cyclistic data set for the year 2020 to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

###Stakeholders:

Lily Moreno: The director of marketing. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.
Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analysing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.
Cyclistic executive team: The executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.
